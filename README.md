Hello, I am Varun Teja Pursuing Bachelor of Technology In the area of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at School of Technology Woxsen University, I was born & raised in HYD. I come from a family of four, my father is a businessman, my mother is home maker, and my brother is currently pursuing 1st Year in Bachelor of Technology.
Iâ€™m a person where I can take up any challenges and have the leadership skills and take any responsibilities and has an exuberant mindset.
Coming to my Technical skills. I have had hands on experience with python since 12th grade and Machine Learning algorithms since B. Tech. I have completed several projects based on Machine Learning Supervised learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Classification and Decision Trees.
I have an Experience of 2 Months as Intern/ Trainee Support at Tech Mahindra where I worked on Natural Language Processing using NLTK Library, Tensor Flow, Keras, Scikit Learning and even worked on BERT and ELMO Models 
I have participated in Machine Knight a ML Competition which consisted of 2 rounds where round 1 consisted of a quiz and in round two, I was given a abstract and a dataset for House rent Prediction using supervised machine learning algorithm and had also integrated it to front end using Rest API.
Few of the projects that I had worked on using ML Algorithms are Fraud Detection, Uber Analysis, Car Price Prediction, Churn Analysis and Sentimental Analysis on Twitter Dataset.
